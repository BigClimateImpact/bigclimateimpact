<h1>Two ways to help Big Climate Impact right now</h1>

<p>Big Climate Impact is a volunteer project. The people working on it
    care about addressing climate change as soon as possible. Our biggest
    needs right now are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Candidate data update</li>
    <li>Social media posting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Candidate data update</h2>

<p>As of December 18, 2021, we've got a database that includes basic
    information for more than 2,000 candidates for state and federal
    races across the country. Many candidates (including incumbents!)
    haven't announced they're running yet.
</p>

<p>We need to start searching for the
    candidates to find out how well they match up against our
    criteria for <a href="choosing" style="link">choosing</a> the best.
    Ideally, we'd have volunteers from each state who will follow up on the
    data and recommendations for their state.
</p>
<p>If you want to help out with gathering data about candidates,
    <a href="https://form.jotform.com/213268515613050">fill out this form</a>
    and be sure to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BigClimateImpact">join the subreddit</a>
    to coordinate.
</p>

<h2>Social media posting</h2>
<p>We've got Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, a Facebook page, a YouTube channel, a
    Substack, and maybe others that I'm forgetting. One person can't keep up
    with all of those channels. If you want to help kickstart our social media
    efforts, reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/dangoor">@dangoor</a>
    on Twitter or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dangoor">u/dangoor</a> on
    Reddit.
</p>
<p>Most of our coordination is going to happen in
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BigClimateImpact/">r/BigClimateImpact</a>,
    so you should also feel free to post ideas there.</p>
