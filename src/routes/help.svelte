<h1>Two ways to help Big Climate Impact right now</h1>

<p>Big Climate Impact is a volunteer project. The people working on it
    care about addressing climate change as soon as possible. Our biggest
    needs right now are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Design</li>
    <li>Candidate data update</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>We need a better logo and the site design can use some improvement.
</p>

<h2>Candidate data update</h2>

<p>As of November 20, 2021, we've got a database that includes basic
    information for more than 1,000 candidates for the US House of
    Representatives. Many incumbents haven't even announced their
    candidacy yet.
</p>

<p>Once we have the basic records, we need to start searching for the
    candidates to find out how well they match up against our
    criteria for <a href="choosing" style="link">choosing</a> the best.
