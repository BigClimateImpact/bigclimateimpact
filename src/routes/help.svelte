<h1>Two ways to help Big Climate Impact right now</h1>

<p>Big Climate Impact is a volunteer project. The people working on it
    care about addressing climate change as soon as possible. Our biggest
    needs right now are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Web design</li>
    <li>Candidate data update</li>
</ul>

<h2>Web design</h2>

<p>I'm not a designer and this site does not look as good as it can.
    It looks better than some of the candidate's sites that I've seen,
    but the topic deserves better.
</p>

<h2>Candidate data update</h2>

<p>As of November 20, 2021, we've got data files that include basic
    information for more than 1,000 candidates for the US House of
    Representatives. Many incumbents haven't even announced their
    candidacy yet. There are thousands more state representative and
    senate candidates that need records added.
</p>

<p>Once we have the basic records, we need to start searching for the
    candidates to find out how well they match up against our
    criteria for <a href="choosing" style="text-underline">choosing</a> the best.
