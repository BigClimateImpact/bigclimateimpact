    <h1>What makes a Big Climate Impact candidate?</h1>
    <p>Whether a candidate is Democratic, Republican, or a third party, we'd be
        happy to recommend them if they are proposing realistic paths to
        addressing climate change. Even better if they're an incumbent with a
        proven track record!
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it's not <em>quite</em> that simple, because we want to use
        our votes strategically to maximize our impact.
    </p>
    <h2>1. How they approach climate change</h2>
    <p>There are at least three main categories of candidates on the issue
        of climate change:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Supports a wide-variety of steps to reach net zero emissions
            rapidly.
        </li>
        <li>Has a platform of natural gas, nuclear and carbon capture.</li>
        <li>Questions the "science" of climate change, instead talking about
            "natural cycles".
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first is the best. People will have arguments about which approaches
        to take and how much money to put toward each, but plans that reflect
        the far-reaching changes required are all worth discussing.
    </p>
    <p>We need to keep a close eye on those that believe the science of climate
        change but offer up bogus or inadequate solutions.
        People pitching <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/clearing-up-the-facts-behind-trumps-clean-coal-catchphrase/">"clean coal"</a>
        are not serious. People pushing for natural gas exports, nuclear, and
        carbon capture are at least discussing approaches that will reduce
        CO2 emissions and there's some hope that we can talk to them into more
        later.
    </p>
    <p>A majority of Americans believe that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/global-warming-perceptions-states-more-americans-accept-fault-n1265213">global warming is caused by
        human activity</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454633/pew-research-american-attitudes-climate-change-fossil-fuels-renewable-energy">close to two-thirds see it as an urgent problem to address</a>.
        Those that are claiming it's not happening are already in a shrinking
        minority, but they're still going to be impossible to work with to
        get anything done.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Electability and ability to boost other BCI candidates</h2>
    <p>Without a doubt, there will be third party candidates with worthy
        plans for climate policy, but unless their election is determined
        through <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used">ranked choice voting</a>,
        they will almost certainly lose.
    </p>
    <p>There may be a candidate who doesn't have a good plan for climate but
        whose election will provide more power to others who do through
        things like committee assignments. Barring a better candidate showing
        up, we may still support them.
    </p>
    <h2>3. We will not support an anti-democracy candidate</h2>
    <p>A disturbing number of candidates support baseless claims of widespread
        voter fraud and seek to make voting more difficult for millions of
        legitimate voters (a majority of whom they believe wouldn't vote for
        them). Such candidates would be bad for America, and they all <em>also</em>
        seem to have no desire to address climate change. These people will not find support on this
        site.
    </p>
    <p>Conversely, we <em>will</em> support candidates who have stood up
        for democracy over those that don't. Sometimes, voting for one of these
        candidates even if they don't have a plan for climate change will be
        our best course of action. A majority of Americans support climate
        action, but if we're subject to minority rule we're not likely to get it.
