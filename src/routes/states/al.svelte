    <h2>Dates to remember</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary: <b>May 24, 2022</b></li>
        <li>Runoff: <b>June 21, 2022</b></li>
        <li>General: <b>November 8, 2022</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recommendations for Alabama's primary elections</h2>
    <p>As of this writing, there is only one candidate in Alabama that
        we can definitively recommend: <b>Terell Anderson</b> in the
        2nd district. Terell supports the Green New Deal, which is a plan
        that is comprehensive enough to address climate change.
        Mr. Anderson's primary opponents have not announced concrete
        climate change plans.
