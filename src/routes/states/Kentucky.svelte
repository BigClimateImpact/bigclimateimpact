<h2>Adopt Kentucky!</h2>

<p>We've taken a look at all of the currently-announced candidates for the
    federal offices in Kentucky. The incumbents are missing from that group,
    and likely others are as well, so we don't have enough information yet
    to make primary recommendations.
</p>

<p>That said, Kentucky's filing deadline for the primaries is the earliest
    in the country: January 7th. After that, we'll want to get our Kentucky
    recommendations squared away for the primaries. If you're interested in
    helping out with this, <em>especially</em> if you're a Kentucky resident,
    <a href="/help">let us know</a>.
