    <h2>Recommendations for Alabama's primary elections</h2>
    <p>As of this writing, there is only one candidate in Alabama that
        we can definitively recommend: <b>Terell Anderson</b> in the
        2nd district. Terell supports the Green New Deal, which is a plan
        that is comprehensive enough to address climate change.
        Mr. Anderson's primary opponents have not announced concrete
        climate change plans.
