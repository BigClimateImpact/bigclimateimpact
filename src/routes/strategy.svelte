    <title>The best strategy for a Big Climate Impact</title>

    <h1>What's one thing you can do to make a Big Climate Impact?</h1>
    <p>You may have a whole long list of ways you've heard to reduce your
        greenhouse gas emissions. Everything from eating less meat to adding
        solar panels to your house to getting an electric car. There <em>are</em>
        many things like that which you can do, but none of them are going to have
        a big impact.
    </p>
    <p>The biggest thing that you, as an American citizen, can do to address climate
        change <em>right now</em> is to support <em>and vote for</em> candidates
        who take the issue seriously.
    </p>
    <h2>A great video on the subject</h2>
    <p>YouTube channel "Kurzgesagt — In a Nutshell" made a terrific video asking
        the question: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiw6_JakZFc">Can YOU fix climate change?</a>.

        can skim.

    <h2>Addressing climate change requires big levers</h2>
    <p>In the 2000s, fossil fuel giant <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham">BP ran
        an ad campaign</a> to get people thinking about their individual
        "carbon footprint". While individual people do contribute to climate
        change in their daily lives, the fact of the matter is that there's
        a giant web of emissions that an individual is almost powerless to
        correct. In the Kurzgesagt video (which is well worth the 15 minutes),
        they mention that an American who manages to have zero emissions for
        their entire life would only offset a <em>single second</em> of global
        greenhouse gas emissions.
    </p>
    <p>But you <em>do</em> have one really large lever you can pull to
        deal with climate change: your vote! Our political leaders at the
        federal, state, and local levels can create policies around
        electricity generation, help make it cheaper to buy electric cars,
        help fund development of technologies to help remove carbon from the
        air, and much more. They have the tools to open up economic opportunity
        <em>and</em> deal with climate change.
    </p>
    <p>Adding solar panels to your house is a step toward clean energy, but
        any gains would be <em>crushed</em> if you vote for a candidate who
        <a href="choosing">votes against policies to address climate change</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Vote!</h2>
    <p>From late 2021 through November 2022, supporting candidates who
        will address climate change and voting for them (starting in the
        primaries!) is the most important thing <em>you</em> can do. After
        that, we can look for the next step.
