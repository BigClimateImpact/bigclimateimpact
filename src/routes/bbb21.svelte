    <p>On November 19, 2021, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/manish-bapna/house-passes-historic-climate-action-build-back-better-act">passed the
        Build Back Better Act</a>, which is the most significant climate
        legislation passed to date. Now, it's in the Senate's hands, so
        you should <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm">contact
        your Senator</a> and let them know you support the Build Back Better Act,
        especially its climate provisions.
    </p>
    <p>You've undoubtedly seen very large numbers thrown around:
        "A $1.75 trillion bill" or "$555 billion for climate action". It's
        important to note that these figures are for <em>10 years</em>.
        We spend <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/budget-explainer-national-defense">more than $700 billion every year on the military</a>.
        That means our military budget is 10 times what we're talking about
        spending in this bill to address climate change.

    <h2>What Build Back Better gets us, in brief</h2>
    <p>This <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/manish-bapna/house-passes-historic-climate-action-build-back-better-act">NDRC article</a> and
    the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/">White House page</a> about the bill
    both provide good detail. Here's just a quick bullet list of what the bill provides for climate action:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rebates and tax credits to help middle class families shift to clean electricity and vehicles,</li>
        <li>Incentives to make sure US companies are manufacturing what we need in decarbonizing our economy,</li>
        <li>Help for the deployment of cleaner transit and more energy efficient homes, including within low-income communities, and</li>
        <li>Investment in smarter agriculture and improved stewardship of forests.</li>
    </ul>

    <textarea class="w-full text-primary p-1" rows="15" wrap="soft">Dear Senator,

As your constituent, I wanted to express my support for the Build Back Better Act. It positions America to take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate change, rather than just being victims to its effects.

The more America invests in leading a decarbonized future, the better equipped we will be for the defining changes of the 21st century.

I urge you to vote in favor of BBB, and know that my future votes will be for those serious about addressing climate change.

Sincerely,
    </textarea>
